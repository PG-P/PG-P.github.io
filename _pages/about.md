Hello everyone!

My name is **Piergiorgio Panero** and I am an Italian mathematician, currently in France. 
My interests vary in:
1. Data Science
2. Algebraic Topology
3. Topological Data Analysis
4. Deformation Theory

I would like to understand how Git works, and try to learn tons of new stuff.

*BUT HOW??* 

This is my LinkedIn page, not very up to date nor interesting, but you may give a look anyway: [Piergiorgio Panero.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piergiorgio-panero-8922691aa/)

I post in my Blog page my random interests: hiking, maths stuff, literature, etc.
