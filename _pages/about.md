Hello everyone!

My name is **Piergiorgio Panero** and I am an Italian mathematician, currently in France. 
My interests vary in:
1. Data Science
2. Algebraic Topology
3. Topological Data Analysis
4. Deformation Theory

I would like to understand how Git works, and try to learn tons of new stuff.

*BUT HOW??* 

This is my LinkedIn page, not very up to date nor interesting, but you may give a look anyway: [Piergiorgio Panero.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piergiorgio-panero-8922691aa/)

Probably I may even learn how to create a website here, so to show everyone my CV's and projects, but for sure it will take a while.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
